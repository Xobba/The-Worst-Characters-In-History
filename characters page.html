              <h3 class="post-title">Avoiding Comparisons, But Also Failing</h3>
              <div class="roast">
                  <p>Greg Gaines is the most insufferable a**hole you will ever meet. And the worst part about it is that he doesn't even know it.
                  Throughout the entire book Greg has only one thing in mind and that's his highschool reputation. As the title infers, there
                  is, in fact, a girl who is dying. Her name is Rachel and she has cancer. (I think it is important that I mention that this book was published three
                  months after The Fault In Our Stars. And we all know how popular TFIOS became.) Anyway, Jesse Andrews became so hell bent on avoiding the
                  inevitable comparisons between his book and John Green's that he destroyed the entire thing. Unlike Augustus from TFIOS, Greg is a main character who lacks
                  sentiment, empathy, or just common decency. He learns that a girl from his childhood has cancer and instead of being compassionate towards her
                  and being a <i>real</i> friend, he spends all his time worrying about his "low profile" at school. Instead of actually connecting with Rachel,
                  Greg decides he would rather be the funny guy. While being funny is great and can help people take their mind off of things, <b>only ever telling jokes is
                  not acceptable.</b> So after Rachel dies, like freaking dies, the principal of the school asks Greg to speak at an event in her honor and he has the nerve
                  to get mad. I mean, his friend Earl even tells him off about how insensitive he is being. I think Jesse Andrews could have avoided comparisons to TFIOS by incorporating
                  the comedy bits, which he already had. I mean, don't get me wrong, the character Earl adds for some wacky and funny moments. I don't think Jesse Andrews needed to turn Greg
                  into an Anti-Augustus; he just needed to make his book more comedy and journey-based rather
                  than focusing on romance and coming-of-age like John Green did. Me and Earl and The Dying Girl could have been a perfect mix of sentiment and comedy, but instead, it was
                  a steaming pile of infuriatingly apathetic behavior.

                  <div class="roast">
                      <p>Jace Wayland is the main character, Clary Fray’s, love interest throughout the series.
                        He’s devilishly attractive and, according to his description, charming. The only issue is, Jace never says a damn thing that would classify him as charming.
                        Instead, he is snarky, rude, and conceited.
                        Because he is attractive, the tone towards Jace is always positive.
                        Jace could tell Clary to rot in hell and she’d forigve him the next day.
                        The only time I even remotely liked Jace was when his adoptive family was shunning him.
                        Instead of Cassandra Clare showing that Jace was likeable through his actions, we were told he was.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Stop Writing Hate-able Main Characters</h3>
          <div class="roast">
              <p>Margo Roth Spiegelman is the love interest of Quentin Jacobsen, the main character.
                He has been in love with her since they were kids and he used to be best friends with her.
                I mean, they found a dead body together when they were 9.
                But as they got older, Margo stopped hanging out with him completely and now, she’s popular.
                After years of not talking, Margo knocks on Quentin’s window and asks him for a favor.
                She basically needs his help to get revenge on her friends and commit crimes in doing so.
                And to cut this story short, she runs away and leaves clues to be found and Quentin’s dumbass
                wastes the last few weeks of his senior year looking for her.
                When he finally finds her, after skipping his graduation, Margo decides she doesn’t want to return home.
                She tells Quentin, he should leave his decent life to come with her!
                This is why I can’t stand Margo.
                She hadn’t talked to Quentin in years and decided to just pop up.
                And then she schedules her little runaway and clues to line up with graduation.
                She 100% knew that if Quentin came for her, he would miss an important moment in his own life.
                Just because she wasn’t happy with her life at home and her friends does not mean it comes before Quentin’s situations.
                She really isn’t special at all, yet the writing makes it seems like she is and that Quentin’s
                search for her is justified because she’s “not like other girls”. In conclusion,
                Margo is an inconsiderate, "quirky" girl and Quentin is an inconsiderate idiot. But we’ll talk about him later.

            <P> I've read a few books and watched a couple films in my life and
                nothing bothers me more than poor
                character developement. So I decided to

                the worst characters I've ever come across.
